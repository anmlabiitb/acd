		    <h3>PREFACE</h3>
			  <p>There are various books available on antennas. The emphasis of many of these books is on theoretical
			    aspects of antennas. However, to design an antenna for a specific application, many additional
			    parameters have to be taken into account. Authors feel that there is a need of a book that mainly covers
			    the concept and design. This Book entitled “Antennas – Concept and Design” covers basic fundamentals
			    of antennas, Dipole, Monopole, Loop, Slot, Linear and Planar arrays, Microstrip Antennas (MSA), MSA
			    Arrays, Helical, Horn, Yagi-Uda &amp;amp; Log-Periodic and Reflector Antennas. For all these antennas, the
			    emphasis is on explanation of basic concepts followed by practical design aspects. The book also gives
			    simple design equations, simulated results and measured results of fabricated antennas. This book will
			    be very useful to the students, faculty members and engineers from telecom and wireless industries,<br>
			    defence and space organizations, etc., who work in the areas of antennas, RF and microwave systems.
			    To the best of the authors’ knowledge, for the first time, an attempt has been made to introduce the
			    book in the form of Power Point Presentation (PPT), so that readers can grasp the ideas quickly instead
			    of reading long paragraphs. A well known quote is: “A picture is worth a thousand words”. Practice
			    problems are provided at the end of each chapter with answer keys at the end of the book.<br>
			    All the topics covered in this book are recorded in a course entitled “Antennas” through NPTEL, IIT
			    Bombay, where 6000+ participants enrolled in both 2017 and 2018. Readers can refer to the YouTube
			    links provided at the start of each chapter for detailed explanation.
			    Our prime minister’s initiative of “MAKE IN INDIA” will be more successful if it follows “DESIGN IN<br>
		      INDIA” principle and this book is oriented towards this slogan.			  </p>
